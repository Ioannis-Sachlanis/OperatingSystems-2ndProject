Lazy Page Allocation at xv6

The exercise was carried out following the instructions described in the speech. More specifically, I started by implementing the vmprint function in the kernel/vm.c file, with its corresponding addition to defs.h. To make calling the above function easier, implemented by void printwalk(pagetable_t pagetable, int depth).
